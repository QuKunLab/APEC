(1)**project01** is an example of running APEC from the raw fastq files. Users only need to copy the raw fastq files in **data** folder to start the analysis. This project contains single cell samples of human's leukemic stem cells, leukemic blast cells, LMPP, monocytes and HL60 cells, from "Schep, A.N., Wu, B., Buenrostro, J.D. & Greenleaf, W.J. chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data. Nat Methods 14, 975-978 (2017)".
.

(2)**project02** is an example of running APEC from the user's own fragment count matrix. Users need to copy "cell_info.csv" in **data** folder, "filtered_reads.csv" in **matrix** folder, and "filtered_reads.csv" in **peak** folder to start the clustering. This project contains single cell samples from the forebrain of adult mice, from "Preissl, S. et al. Single-nucleus analysis of accessible chromatin in developing mouse forebrain reveals cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation. Nat Neurosci 21, 432-439 (2018)".
