(1) **project01** contains single cell samples from hematopoietic stem cell differentiation project (including HSC, MPP, CMP, GMP, MEP, LMPP, CLP, pDC, and UNK cells), from "Buenrostro, J.D. et al. Integrated Single-Cell Analysis Maps the Continuous Regulatory Landscape of Human Hematopoietic Differentiation. Cell 173, 1535-1548 e1516 (2018)". Users can run "python script_for_project01.py" to obtain Fig. 1b, 1d, 3c, and 3d of the APEC paper.

**NOTE**: In "script_for_project01.py", "../reference/" should be the **reference** folder built by the user, and filled with the following files downloaded from http://galaxy.ustc.edu.cn:30803/APEC/reference/:

    hg19_RefSeq_genes.gtf, hg19_chr.fa, hg19_chr.fa.fai,
    mm10_RefSeq_genes.gtf, mm10_chr.fa, mm10_chr.fa.fai,
    JASPAR2018_CORE_vertebrates_non-redundant_pfms_meme.txt, tier1_markov1.norc.txt

**NOTE**: Monocle is very sensitive to the input matrix. For example, when we use different versions of scipy (such as 1.0.0 and 1.2.1), the PCA matrices generated by sklearn will be slightly different (difference < 1.0e-7), and even this small difference will produce completely different shapes of trajectories by monocle. Different versions of many other related libraries/packages in python and R environment will also result in different shapes of trajectories.


(2) **project02** contains single cell samples from the forebrain of adult mice, from "Preissl, S. et al. Single-nucleus analysis of accessible chromatin in developing mouse forebrain reveals cell-type-specific transcriptional regulation. Nat Neurosci 21, 432-439 (2018)". Users can run "python script_for_project02.py" to obtain Fig. 2a, 2b, and 2e of the APEC paper.


(3) **project03** contains single cell samples of the leukemic stem and blast cells of two different patients (SU070 and SU353), from "Schep, A.N., Wu, B., Buenrostro, J.D. & Greenleaf, W.J. chromVAR: inferring transcription-factor-associated accessibility from single-cell epigenomic data. Nat Methods 14, 975-978 (2017)". Users can run "python script_for_project03.py" to obtain Fig. S3b of the APEC paper.
